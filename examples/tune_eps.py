tune_eps.py - DBSCAN tuning workflow

Walks through three stages of tuning the in-plane neighborhood radius
EPS_XY for clustering AMPM data into individual parts:

  Stage 1: Compute and plot the k-distance curve. The "elbow" of this
           curve is a good initial guess for EPS_XY.
  Stage 2: Run DBSCAN with the chosen EPS_XY and inspect the result.
           Check cluster count, noise fraction, and per-cluster sizes.
  Stage 3: Validate cluster-to-part mapping. The QuantAM parts CSV gives
           the known number of parts and their XY positions. A correctly
           tuned EPS_XY produces (a) the right number of clusters and
           (b) sub-millimeter centroid distances to known part positions.

How to use
----------
1. Set EPS_XY below to your initial guess (try 0.5 if you have no idea).
2. Run `python tune_eps.py`.
3. Look at the k-distance plot. If the elbow is at a different y-value
   than your guess, update EPS_XY and rerun.
4. Check Stage 2's cluster count. If it doesn't match the expected
   number of parts, adjust EPS_XY:
       - Too many clusters → EPS_XY too small, increase it
       - Too few clusters  → EPS_XY too large, decrease it
5. Iterate until Stage 3 reports max distance < ~1 mm and no warnings.

Note on EPS_Z
-------------
EPS_Z controls clustering in the through-thickness direction. It is
typically picked as a small multiple of layer thickness — usually
2 * LAYER_THICKNESS = 0.06 mm. This is robust to single-layer data gaps
without bridging across larger discontinuities. You generally do NOT
need to tune EPS_Z via the k-distance curve; the rule of thumb works.

If your build has frequent missing-data layers, increase EPS_Z to
4-5 * LAYER_THICKNESS. If parts are clustering into vertical slabs
rather than full-height columns, EPS_Z is too small.
